title: Curing RSI (Repetitive Strain Injury)

Being a computer user all my life was bound to catch up with me, and it did
several years ago.  One day, I started having constant pain in my wrists, hands
and fingers.  Having never experienced something like this before, I assumed
it would go away, so I continued working as per usual for the next week.
Unfortunately the pain did not go away and I was forced to cut down on typing
and using my PC.

After seeing my doctor, he prescribed the usual RSI treatment,
anti-inflammatory medication (Naprosyn), a wrist brace and as little typing and
computer use as possible.  I was also asked to do an EMG (electromyogram) to
see if I had carpal tunnel syndrome, this test came back negative.  I was also
referred to a specialist which suggested further traditional treatment options,
an operation (if even possible) or a cortisone shot, neither of which sounded
too inviting.

After many months of the standard treatment and heaps of trouble performing day
to day tasks at work, I decided to investigate alternative remedies to the
problem.  These remedies have helped me recover almost entirely after several
months of use.

Obviously, the following suggestions may not work for everyone, but they
certainly did for me.  I have no association with any of the companies that
produce the products mentioned below, my comments are purely based on personal
experience.

* **Traditional Medication**: I stopped using the anti-inflammatory medication
  and continued to use the wrist brace.  The wrist brace was used on bad days
  when I had a reasonable amount of pain.
* **[CT Cream (now known as Penetrex)](http://www.penetrex.com/)**: I was
  extremely impressed with this cream, it offered an effective
  anti-inflammatory solution which is completely natural and has no known side
  effects.  I found this immediately effective and calming, it actually is also
  helpful for other aches too.
* **Myotherapy**: A friend (Julia) is a myotherapist, which I went and saw for
  several weeks.  She performed some deep massage and dry needling (similar to
  acupuncture).  I found the deep massage extremely helpful in particular.
  Just follow the advice given to you by your therapist about water consumption
  and stretches and you should notice improvement.
* **[Powerballs](http://www.powerballs.com/)**: These little exercise devices
  are simply amazing! I would say that they played a huge role in helping my
  condition.  They assist you with strengthening your wrists and getting the
  blood flow going to aid recovery.
* **Cardio**: Walking and cycling are extremely helpful in stimulating blood
  flood to hands and wrists.  If you are over-weight, this is a good
  opportunity to lose a couple of kgs too.  Having a healthy cardiovascular
  system assists with the recovery of RSI.

I hope that this information was helpful to someone out there :)
