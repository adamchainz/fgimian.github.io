Hello there, my name is **Fotis** but most my friends call me Fots or something
more insulting ... but I'll usually respond to just about anything :)

I like computers ... oh who am I kidding, I freaking love them!  I think they
are probably the meaning of life or something of that magnitude.  I mean
really, how cool are these things!?!?

Welcome to my blog which is dedicated to technology with a focus on coding,
desktop computers and servers with a little tablet thrown in on the odd day.
I'll likely be focusing most of my posts around OSs such as
**Microsoft Windows** (don't hate a playa who likes Windows yo),
**Ubuntu Server**, **Redhat** and **Solaris** (because I'm forced to work with
it).  In terms of development, I'm really loving **Python** right now and will
likely be focusing on it as it is without doubt the prettiest language on the
planet with wonderfully strict layout rules (PEP8).

For my day job, I work in a DevOps team who primarily develop and maintain
monitoring systems for a slew of servers and network devices.  I also produce
trance music on the side which has always been a passion of mine.

In summary:

``` python
if reading('fotsies_technology_blog'):
    print blab_about('coding')
    print blab_about('software')
    print blab_about('operating_systems')
    print blab_about('server_builds')
    print blab_about('tips_n_tricks')
else:
    print 'booooooooooooooooo!, for that you get a nasty 3 return code! ewwwww'
    exit(3)
```

I hope everyone enjoys reading this blog and potentially finds it useful too!
